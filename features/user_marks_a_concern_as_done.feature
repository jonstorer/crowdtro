  Scenario: User Marks a concern as done
    Given a "Too many concerns" Concern exists
    And I am on the site
    Then I should see "Too many concerns" within the pending concerns list
    When I click the complete link within the "Too many concerns" concerns element
    Then I should not see "Too many concerns" within the pending concerns list
    But I should see "Too many concerns" within the complete concerns list

    And I click the pending link within the "So Many" concerns element
    Then I should see "So Many" within the pending concerns list
    #But I should not see "So Many" within the complete concerns list
